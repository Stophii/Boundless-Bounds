# Boundless-Bounds

## Description

A walkthrough on how to approach UI in Turbo!

## Lets talk about text

On any new Turbo project we are subject to a 256x144 canvas. This doesn't seem like a lot of space to allocate to a UI. On top of that it roughly allows 50 characters using the basic turbo font from screen to screen.

This usually amounts to about one sentence. Well when we are writing up descriptions one sentence doesn't always cut it.

I have a few tips and tricks that will remedy this early developer issue.

```rust
pub fn wrap_textbetter(text: &str, max_line_length: usize) -> String {
    let mut lines = Vec::new();
    let mut current_line = String::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        if !current_line.is_empty() && current_line.len() + word.len() + 1 > max_line_length {
            lines.push(current_line);
            current_line = String::new();
        }
        if !current_line.is_empty() {
            current_line.push(' ');
        }
        current_line.push_str(word);
    }

    if !current_line.is_empty() {
        lines.push(current_line);
    }

    lines.join("\n")
}
```

Introducing `wrap_textbetter` a function that will allow you to write out a string as long as you want and then set a character limit and wrap it.

It gets rid of any excess space if your sentence hit the character limit on an empty space and allows for clean text wrapping. Simple and easy.

It's even easy to call

```rust
let text = "This is a really long sentence that needs to wrap to a new line or it'll spill off screen.";
let wrapped = wrap_textbetter(text, 50);
text!(&wrapped, x = 0, y = 20, color = 0xffffffff);
```

Just set a `text` and a `wrapped`. the `wrapped` is just referencing the `text` and a character limit. You can rename `text` or `wrapped` to whatever you desire, it's flexible!

Here is an example!

> **Tip:** Turbo has it's own built in text wrapping with `text_box!` macro!

## UI done simply

Most games you make are going to need a UI of some sort and that UI will most likely consist of menus. A really simple way to set up a menu is through a `selection` in the gamestate intiliazed as a `usize`

```rust
struct GameState {
    menu_selection: usize,
  }
impl GameState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            menu_selection: 0,
        }
    }
```

I've called mine `menu_selection` and with it you can easily setup a simple menu.

Combining `wrap_textbetter` and the `menu_selection` will give me a basic menu if I add in some `gamepad` inputs to change the value of `menu_selection`

Lets change the `update` to show just how simple it can be to add in UI elements

```rust
fn update(&mut self) {
    let text = "Shop Fight Run Item";
    let wrapped = wrap_textbetter(text, 5);
    text!(&wrapped, x = 0, y = 20, color = 0xffffffff);

    if gamepad(0).up.just_pressed() {
        if self.menu_selection > 0 {
            self.menu_selection -= 1
        } else {
            self.menu_selection = 3
        }
    };

    if gamepad(0).down.just_pressed() {
        if self.menu_selection < 3 {
            self.menu_selection += 1
        } else {
            self.menu_selection = 0
        }
    };

    if (0..=3).contains(&self.menu_selection) {
        rect!(
            x = 30,
            y = 20 + self.menu_selection * 9,
            w = 9,
            h = 9,
            rotation = 45,
            color = 0xff0000ff
        );
    }
}
```

A nice simple easy menu. You can highlight the text instead and use `match` instead of `contains` for more control

```rust
match self.menu_selection {
    0 => rect!(x = 30, y = 20, w = 9, h = 9, rotation = 45, color = 0xff0000ff),
    1 => rect!(x = 30, y = 29, w = 9, h = 9, rotation = 45, color = 0xff0000ff),
    2 => rect!(x = 30, y = 38, w = 9, h = 9, rotation = 45, color = 0xff0000ff),
    3 => rect!(x = 30, y = 47, w = 9, h = 9, rotation = 45, color = 0xff0000ff),
    _ => {},
}
```

Using `match` will allow us to do a number of things inside each `match` arm so it could be more helpful for a simple menu with more options.

> **Tip:** A new line of text in Turbo is roughly 9 units down using the default font, `medium`. 


## UI done smart

Turbo has your back though, not everything needs to be `wrap_textbetter` and if that is your solution then awesome, you're embracing the fast, simple, and fun style of making games in Turbo. In Turbo we have bounds which can be used on any canvas and it's automatically going to anchor and space things out to your desire.

Step one is to define the `canvas_bounds`

```rust
let canvas_bounds = bounds::canvas();
```

call it what you like but with this setup it's going to pull the resolution from your `turbo.toml` and you'll be able to use that setup a HUD of some sort.

lets approach menus again

```rust
let canvas_bounds = bounds::canvas();

let buttons = canvas_bounds
    .height(100)
    .inset_left(80)
    .inset_right(80)
    .anchor_center(&canvas_bounds)
    .rows_with_gap(4, 12);

for (i, btn) in buttons.into_iter().enumerate() {
    let label = match i {
        0 => "Shop",
        1 => "Fight",
        2 => "Run",
        3 => "Item",
        _ => "",
    };

    // === Change color if hovered ===
    let (fill_color, border_color) = if self.menu_selection == i {
        (0x82c8ffff, 0xffc0cbff) // Hovered colors
    } else {
        (0x0055ffff, 0xffc0cbff) // Default colors
    };

    rect!(
        color = fill_color,
        w = btn.w(),
        h = btn.h(),
        x = btn.x(),
        y = btn.y(),
        border_radius = 4,
        border_size = 1,
        border_color = border_color,
    );

    let btn_inner = btn.inset_left(2).inset_top(4);

    text_box!(
        label,
        x = btn_inner.x(),
        y = btn_inner.y(),
        w = btn.w(),
        h = btn.h(),
        font = "medium",
        color = 0xffffffff
    );
}
```

We can add this under the `match` or `contains` from earlier. This gives us the same control functionality but on a menu written with `bounds`.

Here is a preview with the old menu still visible

## Exploring bounds

Now we've showcased what bounds can do i'll give you a list of methods to get you started using bounds!

- `.height()` sets your bounds height the specified units.
- `.width()` sets your bounds width the specified units.
- `.translate_x()` move your bounds the specified units left or right.
- `.translate_y()` move your bounds the specified units up or down.
- `.inset_left()` shrinks your bounds the specified units on the left side. If inset **exceeds** width your bounds with disappear!
- `.inset_right()` shrinks your bounds the specified units on the right side. If inset **exceeds** width your bounds with disappear!
- `.inset_top()` adds empty space above your bounds shrinking them closer from above. If inset value is too high your bounds will disappear.
- `.inset_bottom()` adds empty space below your bounds shrinking them closer from below. If inset value is too high your bounds will disappear.
- `.anchor_left()` is the ability to anchor your bounds to the left of your specified bounds.
- `.anchor_right()` is the ability to anchor your bounds to the right of your specified bounds.
- `.anchor_center()` centers the bounds in the middle of the specified bounds.
- `.anchor_top()` anchors your bounds to the top of your specified bounds.
- `.anchor_bottom()` anchors your bounds to the bottom of your specified bounds.
- `.rows_with_gap(,)` set a number of rows and a gap size to use.
- `.columns_with_gap(,)` set a number of columns and a gap size to use.

This should be more than enough to get started with using bounds. There is an **TON** of different methods you can tap into with this Turbo macro and you can see even more of them if you `cmd + click` the `bounds` macro inside of Visual Studio Code!

> **Tip:** Our specified bounds are `&canvas_bounds` for this guide. You can easily set up and use a different bounds than `let canvas_bounds = bounds::canvas()`!
